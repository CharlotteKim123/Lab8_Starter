### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
They are related because service workers assist with graceful degradation. Graceful degradation is a design approach that allows the software to function even when certain advanced features are unavailable. Service workers assist with this by their use of caches and giving offline support. The offline support allows the software to save the data and sync the changes once you are back online. This allows the software to be used at any time, any where.
